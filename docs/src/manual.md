## Why use parameters?

A typical optimization model built using `MathOptInterface.jl` (`MOI`for short) has two main components:
1. Variables
2. Constants

Using these basic elements, one can create functions and sets that, together, form the desired optimization model. The goal of `POI` is the implementation of a third type, parameters, which
* are declared similar to a variable, and inherits some functionalities (e.g. dual calculation)
* acts like a constant, in the sense that it has a fixed value that will remain the same unless explicitely changed by the user

A main concern is to efficiently implement this new type, as one typical usage is to change its value to analyze the model behavior, without the need to build a new one from scratch.

## How it works

The main idea applied in POI is that the interaction between the solver, e.g. `HiGHS`, and the optimization model will be handled by `MOI` as usual. Because of that, `POI` is a higher level wrapper around `MOI`, responsible for receiving variables, constants and parameters, and forwarding to the lower level model only variables and constants.

As `POI` receives parameters, it must analyze and decide how they should be handled on the lower level optimization model (the `MOI` model).

## Usage

In this manual we describe how to interact with the optimization model at the MOI level. In the [Examples](@ref) section you can find some tutorials with the JuMP usage.

### Supported constraints

This is a list of supported `MOI` constraint functions that can handle parameters. If you try to add a parameter to
a function that is not listed here, it will return an unsupported error.

|  MOI Function |
|:-------|
|    `ScalarAffineFunction`    |
|    `ScalarQuadraticFunction`    |
|    `VectorAffineFunction`    |


### Supported objective functions

|  MOI Function |
|:-------|
|    `ScalarAffineFunction`    |
|    `ScalarQuadraticFunction`    |

### Declare a Optimizer

In order to use parameters, the user needs to declare a [`ParametricOptInterface.Optimizer`](@ref) on top of a `MOI` optimizer, such as `HiGHS.Optimizer()`.

```julia
using ParametricOptInterface, MathOptInterface, HiGHS
# Rename ParametricOptInterface and MathOptInterface to simplify the code
const POI = ParametricOptInterface
const MOI = MathOptInterface
# Define a Optimizer on top of the MOI optimizer
optimizer = POI.Optimizer(HiGHS.Optimizer())
```

### Parameters

A `MOI.Parameter` is a set used to define a variable with a fixed value that
can be changed by the user. It is analogous to `MOI.EqualTo`, but can be used
by special methods like the ones in this package to remove the fixed variable from the
optimization problem. This permits the usage of multiplicative parameters in lienar models
and might speedup solves since the number of variables is reduced.

### Adding a new parameter to a model

To add a parameter to a model, we must use the `MOI.add_constrained_variable()` function, passing as its arguments the model and a `MOI.Parameter` with its given value:

```julia
y, cy = MOI.add_constrained_variable(optimizer, MOI.Parameter(0.0))
```

### Changing the parameter value

To change a given parameter's value, access its `VariableIndex` and set it to the new value using the `MOI.Parameter` structure.

```julia
MOI.set(optimizer, POI.ParameterValue(), y, MOI.Parameter(2.0))
```

### Retrieving the dual of a parameter

Given an optimized model, one can compute the dual associated to a parameter, **as long as it is an additive term in the constraints or objective**.
One can do so by getting the `MOI.ConstraintDual` attribute of the parameter's `MOI.ConstraintIndex`:

```julia
MOI.get(optimizer, POI.ParameterDual(), y)
```
